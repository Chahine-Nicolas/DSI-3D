## Overview

**DSI-3D** is a differentiable search index for fast and accurate **3D point cloud retrieval**, extending the [Differentiable Search Index (DSI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14100) to 3D spatial data.  
We leverage the [GIT architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14100) and [LoGG3D-Net](https://github.com/csiro-robotics/LoGG3D-Net/tree/main) descriptors to enable **efficient auto-regressive retrieval of 3D scenes**.

DSI-3D was developed for the paper:

*"DSI-3D: Differentiable Search Index for Point Cloud Retrieval"* (CBMI 2025).

The model is trained to associate point cloud representations, using [LoGG3D-Net](https://github.com/csiro-robotics/LoGG3D-Net/tree/main), with corresponding labels. 
During inference, it generates labels auto-regressively via beam search.
